# Setting up Microsoft Visual Studio Code in a Windows PC

The instructions here is for a Windows PC. <br>
For Linux and Mac, it will be added later.<br>

It would be better and preferrable if you install in a specific folder rather than the default path.<br>

Like I have mentioned before, I will installing it in the *LEO* folder.<br>


### Step 1 - Download the Application

Download the offical Microsoft Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).<br>

Click the downloaded file. 

### Step 2 - Accept the License Agreement

Like I said before, we won't be installing there.<br>
We will be doing it in the `LEO` folder; so, change the location.<br>

```
C:\LEO\Microsoft VS Code
```

Just click `Next >`. <br>
