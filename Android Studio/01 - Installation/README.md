# Setting up Android Studio in a Windows PC

The instructions here is for a Windows PC. <br>
For Linux and Mac, it will be added later.<br>

It would be better and preferrable if you install in a specific folder rather than the default path.<br>

Like I have mentioned before, I will installing it in the *LEO* folder.<br>


### Step 1 - Download the Application

Go to the download section of the offical Android website from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).<br>


![Downloads](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/01.png)

<br>

Click on _Download Android Studio_.<br>

You will be seeing something like this.<br>

![Downloads](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/02.png)

<br>

Accept the terms and conditions.<br>
Then click on the _DOWNLOAD ANDROID STUDIO FOR WINDOWS_ button. <br>

### Step 2 - Installation Begins

<br>

Click *Next*. 

<br>

### Step 3 - Choosing Android Virtual Device

If you are going to use your Android or iOS device, it is well and good. <br>
But sometimes, it is better to see the output on the laptop/desktop screen.<br>
Select _Android Virtual Device_ only if your lapotp/desktop can handle it. <br>

![step3](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/04.png)

<br>

Click *Next*. 

<br>

### Step 4 - Changing the Installation Location

By default, the installtion folder would be something like this. <br>

![step4_1](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/05.png)

<br>

Change it to make the installation happen in *LEO* folder.

        C:\LEO\Android\Android Studio

<br>

![step4_2](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/06.png)

<br>

Click *Next*.

<br>

<hr>

### Step 5 - Start Menu Folder Options

I think, it would be better to have a folder in Start Menu. <br>
So, nothing to be changed here. <br>

![step5](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/07.png)

<br>

Click *Install* and begin the installation.

![step6_2](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/09.png)

And the installation has now installed Java JDK, Kotlin libraries, and many more. <br>

<br>

Click *Next*.

No need to import anything because this is the first time we are installing Android Studio. <br>

![step7](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/static/blob/master/SetupStuf/anstudio/installation/img/12.png)

<br>

After this, Android Studio will start.
