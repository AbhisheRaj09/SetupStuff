# Android Studio

If you have already done the following before installing *Android Studio*, **undo / uninstall / remove** it now. :

- Installed Java JDK 8 or higher
- Added the path to the *java* and *javac* in the above to the *Environment Variables*
- Installed Kotlin binaries to execute Kotlin code.
- Added Kotlin to the **Path** variable

I am asking you to do it because, the Android Studio comes with the required Java and Kotlin libraries and binaries. So, there is no need to install the same again.

- 1. [Install Android Studio](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/SetupStuff/tree/master/Android%20Studio/01%20-%20Installation)
- 2. [Add *Java* and *Kotlin* to **Path** variable](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/SetupStuff/tree/master/Android%20Studio/02%20-%20Adding%20Java%20and%20Kotlin%20to%20Path%20variable)
- 3. [Setting up for offline build](https://github.com/KamalDGRT/SetupStuff/tree/master/Android%20Studio/03%20-%20Offline%20Build) (Optional but recommended.)

And this is it. You are now well equipped with the tools to build apps!
